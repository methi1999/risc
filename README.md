# RISC

For our EE224 course project, we were asked to implement a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) with 14 basic general purpose instructions. We implemented it in VHDL and tested it using the popular software Quartus.
This repository contains the entire vhdl code, along with the .qpf file which can be directly opened using Quartus.
